# Final thoughts of exp done in this git repo

Git first looks for email in .git/config in curr project to get the profile and display it in commit on origin and if it can't find email in .git/config it look for email in ~/.gitconfig (globaly config) and then to user name in ./git/config again if the user name is not available here it will again look for the user name in ~/.gitconfig
